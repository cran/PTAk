History of Changes :
---------------------

Package: PTAk
Version: 1.1-2
Date: 2001/04/17
Title: Principal Tensor Analysis on k modes
Author: Didier Leibovici <didier@fmrib.ox.ac.uk>.
Depends: tensor (useful but not necessary)
Description: A multiway method to decompose a tensor (array) of any order,
             as a generalisation of SVD also supporting \emph{non-identity metrics} and \emph{penalisations}.
             2-way SVD with these extensions is also available. The package includes also some other multiway
             methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP.
License: free for non-commercial purposes.

If one does not want to use the tensor package the default arguments of CONTRACTION
and CONTRACTION.list has to be change with usetensor=FALSE.

Some C++ code are currently developed  to speed the core algorithms.
