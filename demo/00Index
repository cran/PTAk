PTA3                      loads and runs demo.PTA3() to perform n PTA3 on the data iris3 bootstrapping 
                          n samples of 15 for each species and look at the  distributions of some
                          Principal Tensors.
PTAk                      loads and runs demo.PTAk() which shows nothing at the moment!
SVDgen                    loads and runs demo.SVDgen() which compares svd and svdsmooth on an image with 
                          added gaussian noise: the default image (ima=NULL) is the timage12 dataset.
