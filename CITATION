Title: Principal Tensor Analysis on k modes
Author: Didier Leibovici     <didier.leibovici@nottingham.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Didier Leibovici <c3s2i@free.fr>
Depends:  tensor, tensorA
Description: A multiway method to decompose a tensor (array) of any order, as a generalisation of SVD also supporting non-identity metrics and penalisations. 2-way SVD with these extensions is also available. The package includes also some other multiway methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP with these extensions.
